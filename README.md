ðŸ“Œ PROJECT DESCRIPTION :






THIS PROJECT INVOLVES BUILDING A PREDICTIVE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL USING SCIKIT-LEARN TO CLASSIFY OR PREDICT OUTCOMES FROM A GIVEN DATASET. A COMMONLY USED EXAMPLE IS SPAM EMAIL DETECTION, WHERE THE MODEL LEARNS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SPAM AND NON-SPAM EMAILS BASED ON FEATURES EXTRACTED FROM THE EMAIL CONTENT. THE GOAL IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE END-TO-END PIPELINE OF A MACHINE LEARNING WORKFLOWâ€”FROM DATA PREPROCESSING TO MODEL EVALUATIONâ€”WITHIN A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.





ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVES :





TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE
TO EXPLORE AND PREPROCESS A REAL-WORLD DATASET
TO TRAIN AND EVALUATE A CLASSIFICATION MODEL USING SCIKIT-LEARN
TO INTERPRET MODEL PERFORMANCE USING METRICS LIKE ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1-SCORE
TO DOCUMENT THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW IN A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FOR REVIEW AND CERTIFICATION




ðŸ›  TECHNOLOGIES USED :





PYTHON    -	PRIMARY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE


SCIKIT-   -  LEARN	MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY FOR MODELING


PANDAS    - 	DATA MANIPULATION AND ANALYSIS


NUMPY     - 	NUMERICAL COMPUTATION


MATPLOTLIB -	DATA VISUALIZATION


JUPYTER NOTEBOOK -	INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT





ðŸŒŸ FEATURES :




DATA LOADING AND CLEANING


FEATURE EXTRACTION AND TRANSFORMATION


MODEL SELECTION (E.G., NAIVE BAYES, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, RANDOM FOREST)


TRAIN-TEST SPLIT FOR VALIDATION


HYPERPARAMETER TUNING USING GRIDSEARCHCV


PERFORMANCE METRICS VISUALIZATION


CONFUSION MATRIX AND ROC CURVE ANALYSIS


FINAL MODEL EXPORT (OPTIONAL)
