ðŸ“Œ PROJECT DESCRIPTION :






This project involves building a predictive machine learning model using Scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes from a given dataset. A commonly used example is spam email detection, where the model learns to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails based on features extracted from the email content. The goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end pipeline of a machine learning workflowâ€”from data preprocessing to model evaluationâ€”within a Jupyter Notebook.





ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVES :





TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE
TO EXPLORE AND PREPROCESS A REAL-WORLD DATASET
TO TRAIN AND EVALUATE A CLASSIFICATION MODEL USING SCIKIT-LEARN
TO INTERPRET MODEL PERFORMANCE USING METRICS LIKE ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1-SCORE
TO DOCUMENT THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW IN A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FOR REVIEW AND CERTIFICATION
